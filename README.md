# Neighborhood Map - Bucharest Museums
This is the final project for Udacity - Front End Development Nanodegree.

The project was built using the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Maps API and Foursquare API

## Description:
- This is a single page applications that features a neighborhood map and lists some of the famous museums in Bucharest, Romania.
-For generating the map, I used the the Maps API by Google and Foursquare was used to get information displayed for the museum markers when clicked.
- The menu in the top-left corner can be opened to reveal a list of all the locations and filter through them by using letters or keywords for the location that you are searching.

## How to:

- Extract the archive and open the project folder
- Open a console and install all the dependencies by using `npm install`
- Start the server with `npm start`
- Go to the browser and type: `http://localhost:3000/` (replace 3000 with the port that you chose to start the server on) in the address bar if a window wasn't already opened when you started the server
- Browse the application and explore the neighborhood and museums

## To run a production build:

- Open the project folder
- Open a console and run `npm run build`
- If suggested, install the dependency required with `npm install -g serve`
- Run `serve -s build` in the console
- Open the browser and type: `http://localhost:3000/` (replace 3000 with the port that you chose to start the server on) in the address bar if a window wasn't already opened when you started the server
